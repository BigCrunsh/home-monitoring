# General Helper Scripts
This is a place for general helper scripts to manage the raspberry.

## Backup
The backup script for the Raspberry PI is running on a Synology Diskstation.
1. Add `authorized_keys` on raspberry (see, e.g., [How To Set Up Authorized Keys](https://wiki.qnap.com/wiki/SSH:_How_To_Set_Up_Authorized_Keys))
2. The `backup_pi.sh` is scheduled as task on the Synology.
