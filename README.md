# Home Monitoring

The project consolidates different scripts and configuration to collect home
montitoring metrics on a Raspberry PI 4; we use an influxDB to store and grafana to visualize the measurements.

Systems to Monitor:
- [Netatmo](https://www.netatmo.com/en-eu) is a smart home weather station.
- [SolarEdge](https://www.solaredge.com/) is a solar
	inverter and monitoring systems for photovoltaic arrays
- [Tankerkoenig](https://creativecommons.tankerkoenig.de/) provides gas station prices
